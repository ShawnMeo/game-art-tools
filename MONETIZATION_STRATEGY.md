# Monetizing Open-Source SaaS Apps

You can absolutely monetize free, open-source tools! Here are proven strategies:

---

## 🎯 **Best Strategies for Your Tools**

### 1. **"Buy Me a Coffee" / Donations** (Easiest Start)
Add a donation button to your apps.

**Services:**
- [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com) - No fees, instant payouts
- [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com) - 5% fee
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) - 0% fees (GitHub pays them!)

**Implementation:**
```jsx
// Add to your App.jsx header
<a href="https://ko-fi.com/yourname" target="_blank" className="donate-btn">
  ☕ Buy me a coffee
</a>
```

**Expected**: $50-200/month if you get 1000+ users

---

### 2. **Premium Features (Freemium Model)**
Keep the core free, charge for advanced features.

**For Channel Packer:**
- ✅ Free: Pack 3 channels (RGB)
- 💎 Premium ($5 one-time): Batch processing, custom presets, 4K+ support

**For Texel Architect:**
- ✅ Free: Basic calculator
- 💎 Premium ($5 one-time): Save presets, export reports, team templates

**Implementation:**
- Use [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) for one-time license keys (10% fee)
- Or [LemonSqueezy](https://lemonsqueezy.com) (5% + payment fees)

---

### 3. **Affiliate Links** (Passive Income)
Recommend tools environment artists already use.

**Examples:**
- Link to Substance Painter on Adobe (affiliate)
- Link to Blender Market assets
- Link to Unreal Marketplace

**Add a "Resources" section:**
```jsx
<div className="resources">
  <h3>Recommended Tools</h3>
  <a href="affiliate-link">Substance Painter</a>
  <a href="affiliate-link">Quixel Megascans</a>
</div>
```

**Expected**: $20-100/month

---

### 4. **Sponsored "Pro" Version** (White Label)
Sell custom-branded versions to studios.

**Example:**
> "Want Channel Packer with your studio's branding? $200 one-time."

Studios love this for internal tools.

---

### 5. **YouTube Tutorials + Ad Revenue**
Create tutorial videos showing how to use your tools.

**Strategy:**
- "How to Pack PBR Textures for Unreal Engine"
- "Texel Density Explained (with Free Calculator)"
- Link to your tools in description

**Expected**: $50-500/month (once you hit 10k+ views/month)

---

### 6. **Patreon / Membership** (Recurring Revenue)
Offer exclusive benefits for supporters.

**Tiers:**
- $3/month: Early access to new features
- $10/month: Custom tool requests
- $25/month: 1-on-1 support

**Expected**: $100-1000/month with 50-100 patrons

---

### 7. **Sell as a "Pro Bundle"**
Package both tools + future tools as a paid bundle.

**Example:**
- Free: Individual tools on GitHub Pages
- $19 one-time: "Environment Artist Toolkit" (all tools + offline versions + priority support)

Use [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com) to sell.
