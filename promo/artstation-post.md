## Title
Free Browser Tools for Game Artists: Channel Packer, Trim Sheet Planner & More

## Article

### The Problem

If you've worked on game art for any length of time, you know the pain of context-switching between heavy applications for simple tasks.

Need to pack 4 grayscale masks into a single texture? Open Photoshop, create channels manually, export.

Want to plan a trim sheet layout before spending hours texturing? Sketch it on paper or hack something together in your DCC.

Creating a presentation sheet for your portfolio? More Photoshop, more manual arrangement.

These small tasks add up. So I built a solution.

### The Tools

#### 📦 Channel Packer

**The Problem:** Combining grayscale masks into RGBA textures is tedious in Photoshop.

**The Solution:** Drag and drop up to 4 masks, assign each to R/G/B/A channels, and export a packed texture in seconds.

**Use Cases:**
- Creating ORM textures for Unreal Engine
- Packing custom mask sets for shaders
- Combining roughness + metallic + AO + height into one file

#### 🗺️ Trim Sheet Planner

**The Problem:** Planning trim sheet layouts is guesswork without visualization.

**The Solution:** A visual grid editor to design your trim sheet structure before you start texturing.

**Use Cases:**
- Planning modular environment sheets
- Designing weapon/prop atlases
- Pre-visualizing UV allocation

---

#### 🖼️ Material Sheet Generator

**The Problem:** Creating professional texture presentations for portfolios is time-consuming.

**The Solution:** Upload your maps, choose a layout, export a clean presentation sheet.

**Use Cases:**
- Portfolio pieces
- Asset store product images
- Client deliverables

### Why Browser-Based?

1. **Instant access** - No installation, works on any machine
2. **Always current** - No update management
3. **Private** - Files never leave your machine
4. **Fast** - No app startup time

### Built For Production

These aren't hobby projects. I built them for my own production workflow:

- Process images client-side using Canvas API
- Support drag-and-drop for fast iteration
- Export in common formats (PNG, JPG, WebP)

Everything is designed to be fast and get out of your way.
