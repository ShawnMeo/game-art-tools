## Individual Tool Descriptions

### Channel Packer

**Tagline:** Pack smarter, not harder.

**Short Description:**
Combine up to 4 grayscale texture masks into a single RGBA channel-packed texture. Essential for shader optimization in any game engine.

**Long Description:**
Channel Packer streamlines one of the most tedious tasks in game texturing: combining multiple grayscale maps into optimized RGBA textures.

Instead of manually assembling channels in Photoshop or Substance, simply drag and drop your masks—roughness, metallic, ambient occlusion, height, or any grayscale map—and export a perfectly packed texture in seconds.

**Key Features:**
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Preview each channel before export
- Supports PNG, JPG, WebP output
- No file size limits
- Completely free, runs in browser

**Use Cases:**
- Combining PBR maps for Unreal Engine materials
- Creating ORM (Occlusion/Roughness/Metallic) textures
- Packing custom mask channels for shader effects

**Tagline:** Plan before you paint.

**Short Description:**
Visualize and plan your trim sheet layouts before committing to detailed texturing. Map out UV space allocation upfront.

**Long Description:**
Trim Sheet Planner helps you design the structure of your trim sheets before diving into Substance Painter or Photoshop.

Define rows and columns, visualize how your layout will use UV space, and plan which elements go where—all in a visual interface that updates in real-time.

**Key Features:**
- Visual grid-based layout editor
- Horizontal and vertical segment planning
- Real-time preview
- Export layout as reference image
