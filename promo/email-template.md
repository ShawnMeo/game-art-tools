### Version A: Personal & Casual

---

Hey!

Quick update—I just launched a free suite of browser tools for game artists.

These are utilities I built for my own workflow and decided to share:

**📦 Channel Packer**  
Pack grayscale masks into RGBA textures. Stop opening Photoshop for this.

**🗺️ Trim Sheet Planner**  
Plan your trim sheet layouts visually before texturing.

**🖼️ Material Sheet Generator**  
Create presentation sheets from your texture maps in seconds.

Everything runs in your browser—no signup, no download.

Let me know what you think. Always looking for feedback and feature ideas.

Cheers,  
[Your name]
